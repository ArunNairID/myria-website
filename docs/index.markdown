# Getting Started with Myria
There are three ways you can quickly get started using Myria. We describe each method below. You can either use our demo cluster, run a local installation or 
launch your own Amazon cluster.

### Using the Myria Demo Cluster

The UW Database Group hosts a demonstration Myria service: <http://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu>.
The demo service runs on Amazon EC2 and is a small version of Myria running on only four instances. We highly recommend this option for new Myria users. 
The demo service is only there to make it easy to get a sense of what Myria is about, but don't use it to do any actual work
or test anything at scale. 

### Launching your own Myria Amazon Cluster (EC2)
For real data analysis, we recommend launching your own Amazon cluster. Instructions are [here](myria-ec2).

### Launching a Local Installation of Myria
If you're interested in running a local version of Myria on your own personal machine (primarily for those interested in Myria development), instructions are [here](myriax/).
