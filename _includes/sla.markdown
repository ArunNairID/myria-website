An important focus of Myria is not just on managing Big Data but on doing so using a cloud service. We are thus studying various aspects of this problem. Specifically, we are studying a new type of SLA that will enable Cloud providers to offer Big Data Management and Analytics as a service with a more user-friendly and performance-friendly service-level agreement (SLA).

Today's pricing models and SLAs are described at the level of compute resources (instance-hours or gigabytes processed). They are also different from one service to the next. Both conditions make it difficult for users to select a service, pick a configuration, and predict the actual analysis cost. To address this challenge, we propose a new abstraction, called a Personalized Service Level Agreement (PSLA), where users are presented with what they can do with their data in terms of query capabilities, guaranteed query performance and fixed hourly prices.
