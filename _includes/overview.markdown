Extracting knowledge out of Big Data today is a high-touch business,  requiring a human expert who deeply understands the application domain  as well as a growing ecosystem of complex distributed systems and  advanced statistical methods. These experts are hired in part for  their statistical expertise, but report that the majority of their time  is spent scaling and optimizing the relatively basic data manipulation  tasks in preparation for the actual statistical analysis or machine  learning step: identifying relevant data, cleaning, filtering, joining,  grouping, transforming, extracting features, and evaluating results.

The Myria project focuses on building a new system called MyriaDB for Big Data Management  that is both fast and flexible, offering this system as a cloud service,  and addressing both the theoretical and systems challenges associated  with Big Data Management as a Cloud service.

We also have other projects related to Big Data management. See our [overview page](https://www.cs.washington.edu/node/8749/).
