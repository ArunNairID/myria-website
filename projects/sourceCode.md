# Source Code

## Myria 

Myria is our novel cloud service for big data management and analytics designed to improve productivity. Myriaâ€™s goal is for users to simply upload their data and for the system to help them be self-sufficient data science experts on their data. Myria queries are executed on a scalable, parallel cluster that uses both state-of-the-art and novel methods for distributed query processing.

To get Myria up and running, you can view the source [here](https://github.com/uwescience/myria).

Developers, please see our [Myria Developer](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/docs/developer.html) page for more information.

Source code used to deploy Myria on Amazon can be found [here](https://github.com/uwescience/myria-ec2-ansible).

## PipeGen

## PSLAManager

Today's pricing models and SLAs are described at the level of compute resources (instance-hours or gigabytes processed). This makes it difficult for users to select a service, pick a configuration, and predict the actual analysis cost. To address this challenge, we propose a new abstraction, called a Personalized Service Level Agreement (PSLA), where users are presented with what they can do with their data in terms of query capabilities, guaranteed query performance and fixed hourly prices.

Source to generate these PSLAs can be found [here](https://github.com/uwdb/PSLAManager).
